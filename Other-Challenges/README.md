## My process

# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about IDE Support for Vue in the [Vue Docs Scaling up Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS style
- [json](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) - object notation of js
- [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) - js framework
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend tooling

### What I learned

Thanks a lot to frontendmentor, I learned more how to design(Desktop, Tabletes, Mobiles) using css with Vuejs the progressive framework, and some basics syntax of json server like how to put, and get files, update, delete, and edit.
